# Analysis-of-COVID-19-Epidemic-Between-Different-Countries-and-Regions
From 2019 to the present, the pandemic has ravaged the world, and this project aims to analyze the statistics of epidemic data from different regions and countries to show the impact of the pandemic on different continents more intuitively through data visualization
From the end of 2019 until now, the Covid-19 pandemic has ravaged the world, affecting the economic development of all countries to varying degrees and producing radical changes in people's lives. We would like to analyze the data of the Covid-19 to see the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on different continents.
